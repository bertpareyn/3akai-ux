/**
 * Utility plugin that handles the responsive left hand navigation interactions.
 *     - Ability to open and close the navigation using the `.oae-lhnavigation-toggle` class on desktop and mobile.
 *     - When a `page link` is clicked on a mobile device the navigation will close (does not apply on desktop). The navigation stays visible when an `action button` is clicked as this doesn't show a new page.
 *     - Toggling the visiblity of the navigation uses css transitions to transition '.oae-lhnavigation' and '.oae-page' to their expanded state on desktop and mobile.
 *     - '.oae-lhnav-collapsing' is set to enable css transitions on the elements. It is removed once the transitions have ended.
 *     - '.oae-lhnav-expanded' is responsible for setting the required properties needed by '.oae-lhnavigation' and '.oae-page' to be shown in their expanded state.
